			Ik gooi hier maar even wat willekeurige tekst neer zodat er wat staat. Wacht... Heeft Sublime Text niet gewoon een functie om Lorem Ipsum te importeren? <br> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod
			tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam,
			quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo
			consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse
			cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non
			proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum. <br> Ok, ja die heeft 	het. Ok√© dan, nice!

			<h3 class="subtitle">Events</h3>
			<p>
			We do many different kinds of things at our school. Teaching is just one of the many things we do for and with our students! A few recent examples of our extracurricular activities are:
				<ul>
					<li>We organised a robot building contest;</li>
    				<li>We built and launched a rocket that can fly up to 1 km high and</li>
    				<li>Several of our students worked together to organise a christmas dinner for refugees.</li>
    			</ul>
			And we also do much more! Our students are always welcome to give their own suggestions, and we are always sure to take these ideas seriously and try our best to make them come true.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<h3 class="subtitle">Future events</h3>
			<p>
			Of course it isn't just a thing of the past that we organise events. We are planning multiple other things in the near future too, and who knows what else may come in the future! For an overview of our planning for the coming time, have a look at the calendar below! There are many exciting things to come, and we hope to share them with you!
