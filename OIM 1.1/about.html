			<h3 class="subtitle">Our goal</h3>
			<p>
				At Horizon Academy we aim to give children the very best education there is.
			</p>
			<h4 class="sub-subtitle">How do we do this?</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>By using the best up-to-date developments in teaching strategies</li>
				<li>Implementing new developments into our curriculum</li>
				<li>Providing depth in different subjects like politics and technology</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				We do this not only via classes. To take Politics for example, we have a yearly event where we take our discussions to the county hall!

			<h3 class="subtitle">Our handbook</h3>
			<p>
				To make sure everything is clear as possible we have a handbook made openly available. In this rulebook we have specified what is and what isn't allowed, because even though we do allow many things, not everything can be permitted.
			</p>
			<p>
				With this handbook everyone is provided with a clear image of our policies in regards to appropriate attire, attendance and so on.

			<h3 class="subtitle">Our information system: Vital Information Resource - Universally Serious</h3>
			<img class="wide_image" src="images/VIR-US.png" alt="VIR-US">
			<p>
				There are many kinds of information that should be available to our students. For example information a teacher wishes to provide for their students, or homework assignments for students who missed a class. This data, together with several other kinds of functional information is provided to students and teachers alike via our Vital Information Resource - Universally Serious network.
