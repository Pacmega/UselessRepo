			<p>
				Horizon Academy is a high school for highly intelligent children, orientated around our very own learning program. Our curriculum is officially approved and unique to our school. It is used for students to not only follow classes, but also take part in additional activities in which they learn deeper and more diverse material. <br> <a href="#Activities" class="reference">Find out more about our upcoming activities below!</a>

			We do many different kinds of things at our school. Teaching is just one of the many things we do! A few recent examples of our extracurricular activities are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We organised a robot building contest;</li>
    				<li>We built and launched a rocket that can fly up to 1 km high and</li>
    				<li>Several of our students worked together to organise a christmas dinner for refugees.</li>
    			</ul>
			<p>
				And we also do much more! Our students are always welcome to give their own suggestions, and we are always sure to take these ideas seriously and try our best to make them come true.

			Of course it isn't just a thing of the past that we organise events. We are planning multiple other things in the near future too, and who knows what else may come in the future! For an overview of our planning for the coming time, have a look at the calendar below! There are many exciting things to come, and we hope to share them with you!
